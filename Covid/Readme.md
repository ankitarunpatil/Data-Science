# Covid-19 

#### Project Motivation
* There are thousands of research papers written on Covid-19. To find a vaccine the doctors, scientists must go through every research paper to find relevant articles.
* The solution to this problem is to create groups or cluster relevant articles together.
* Hence, my motivation behind this project was to help the community by clustering relevant articles together to help find a vaccine on Covid-19.


#### Goal of this project:
* To cluster different research papers together under one section.
* Apply NLP techniques to process the text information based on title, abstract and summary.
* Create clusters by using K-Means algorithm
